    <h1>Pasta!</h1>
    <p>
        Pasta is a (yet another) opinionated pastebin, written using Laravel.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's a personal project, which began as a fun way to relax without staying away from code for too long.</p>
    <p>
        New features, improvements, and fixes will (or won't) come as I implement them. <br>
        Any contributions are welcome, but you really should consider helping other FLOSS projects first. They need it more.
    </p>

        More information, code, roadmap, etc. are on <a href="https://github.com/micalm/pasta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>.
